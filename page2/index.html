        Designer have used element class attribute for CSS styling for ages. Nowadays classes are also used in javascript selectors. This overlapping cause additional problems: Changes in js may cause broken design and changes in design may cause broken js. The last one may be hard to detect especially when design and css are handled by different person.
<!--
<hr/>
Element class seems the best way to query the element from DOM in js code. Other variants like it's relative possition to other elements are very fragile. Let's say that we have the following DOM:
<pre><code>&lt;a&gt; Delete&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a&gt; Edit&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
And both links are handled with javascript. How would you separate them? 
<ul>
	<li><strong>By order</strong>(first, second) will cause problems if designer would like to change the order.</li>
	<li><strong>By id</strong> will fail if you would have a list of elements where each has these links</li>
	<li><strong>By label</strong> is just a fuck up and won't work for multi language application</li>
</ul>
The only one variant that provide the best stability is reference <strong>By class</strong>.
But as stated above class also serves for another purpose - styling. 

The thing that might help is a special prefix(for example "js") for all 'JavaScript classes'.
Like:
<pre><code>&lt;a class="js-new-comment big-blue-button"&gt; New Comment &lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>

And the convention that classes with prefix should only be used in javascript selectors and classes without prefix in CSS.
<br/><br/>
Yes, sometimes it may look like:
<pre><code>&lt;input type='button' class="js-follow-button follow-button"&gt; Follow this person &lt;/input&gt;</code></pre>
But that makes sense to eliminate maintenance problem described above.

        </h2>
        The classic OOP pattern usually called encapsulation implemented in ruby with <em>private</em> and <em>protected</em> <del>keywords</del> methods. The distinction between API and implementation works great with both. The problem is that <em>private</em> doesn't hide method for inherited classes. 
<!--
<hr/>
See the simple example below:

<pre><code>
class A
  private
  def implementation
    puts 'private A'
  end
end

class B < A
  def api
    implementation
  end
end

B.new.api
</code></pre>

And we won't get exception at the last line.<br/>
The real difference between protected and private methods is more specific.<br/>
At first: <em>implementation</em> method can not be called like <em>self.implementation</em> even from class A.
<pre><code>class A
  def api
    self.implementation #exception here
  end
  private
  def implementation
    puts 'private A'
  end
end

A.new.api
</code></pre>
Seamless pure gap. You can do such call if the method would be protected. Can't imagine the case when this limitation is useful. <br/>
<br/>
The second difference is a bit esoteric. Two instances of the same class can access protected methods of each other but not private methods.

<pre><code>class A
  def api(another) #suppose to receive an instance of a
    implementation == another.implementation
  end
  protected
  def implementation
    puts 'private A'
  end
end
A.new.api(A.new)
</code></pre>
Fine for <em>protected</em> but fail for <em>private</em>. Well, this kind of protection do not make a real because of it's rareness.
<br/><br/>

You might do any decision on the points above.<br/>
My conclusion is to not use <em>private</em> at all, because it doesn't give the level of privacy that I expect. <em>private</em> is not suitable for such an extremely dynamic language as Ruby.

It would be so great if we could always feel ourselves as a user of our applications and make  something useful, but not spend time on improving features that won't be familiar. Being a user of the developed application makes it really possible to develop ergonomic and pretty design.

Unfortunately most of the companies are ignoring that simple rule and unfortunately in some cases it is hard to follow. But anyway that is the only one way to build the best product.

            <div class="date">24 Jan 2010</div>
        </h2>
        If you ever work with rails application that is a little bit more complex then a simple CRUD you would know that some of the ActiveRecord magic doesn't work for complex SQL queries. I am primary talking about named scopes stack feature.<br/>
<!--
<hr/>
Let's review the following named_scope that suppose to be usable in different combinations with others:
<pre><code>named_scope :network_of, lambda {|user|
{
:select =&gt; "u.*"
:from =&gt; "users u, followings f1, followings f2",
:conditions =&gt; "f1.follower_id = #{user.id} AND " + 
"f1.followed_id = f2.follower_id AND " +
"f2.followed_id = u.id"
}</code></pre>
It suppose to returns all people that are followed by people that are followed by the given person.
From the SQL point of view that is the simpliest and fastest way to do that with a plain SQL.
But this solution will have some issues with Active Record named scopes stack magic.
See that User.network_for(current_user).all(:limit =>5) will result in SQL exception primary because (:limit => 5) doesn't know about the table alias "users u".
We can not use it in fact.<br/>
The second problem comes to the foreground when we will try to use ActiveRecord features like
User.network_for(current_user).all(:include => :orders). ActiveRecord handles :include in the very different ways and in some cases you will see the SQL exception here as well.<br/>
The problem is that :include sometimes appends some joins to the query that is concatenated to the last table in the :from parameter. To solve that we should make "users" table to be the last one declared in :from parameter.
<pre><code>:select => "users.*"
:from => "followings f1, followings f2, users",
:conditions => "f1.follower_id = #{user.id} AND " + 
"f1.followed_id = f2.follower_id AND " +
"f2.followed_id = users.id"</code></pre>
Summary I would say that using :joins instead of :from/:conditions would give more flexibility and stackability to your named scopes but sometimes :from is more clear and here you got the tip how to use it.

        I was using Vim to do the minor editing in config files for ages. Vim is advanced on basic navigation and editing operations. However I was always prefer IDE for programming because of it's specific to language navigation('go to definition' feature is awesome!), integrated debugger. But while gaining the experience I noticed that all advanced features began to be less important then basic ones. And you should try Vim if you feel the same.<br/>
<!--
<hr/>

The basic concept of vim is that: Vim think in the same way as you do. For example: I want to delete 'd' everything inside 'i' brackets ')' and vim understands my command: di) <br/>
You shouldn't type a dozen of button to move cursor around and finally delete the selected fragment. 
It's hard to adapt because people are use to think in the way that there text editor do. Vim does vice versa. Some people are saying that they don't like vim because it make them think a lot. That's wrong! Vim is trying to make you free from thinking about editing and concentrate on the content.<br/>

General editing in Vim considered up to every small details. Ask yourself if there is some usual task that I am doing inefficiently and search the Vim feature to optimize that in 3-5 keys. And in ninety nine percent of cases you will find it as built in vim command or a plugin.

            <div class="date">27 Oct 2009</div>
        </h2>
        About half of a year ago I was writing about <a href="http://gusiev.com/2009/05/what-do-you-expect-from-interface/">object interface and Liskov Substitution Princeple</a>. In short: Any class instance that extends the base class should pass all <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">unit tests</span> behaviour tests written for base class instance. It was a surprise for me that this concept has already been implemented in RSpec.<br/><br/>

<!--
My previous article was primary inspired by Java programming language and it's interface concept. Unlike Java, Ruby does not have interfaces, but behaviour inheritance is still actual for both languages. RSpec seems the first testing framework that provide the ability to validate LSP and behavior inheritance with 'it_should_behave_like'. <br/>
With Ruby modules(mixins) feature we can build reusable code and include it in different classes<a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Module.html">(read more)</a>. With RSpec we can bundle the tests as well.<br/>

<br/>

Let's review the following module that uses one of the Rails callback and adds some logging:<br/>
<pre><code>
module LoggedModel
  def after_save
    super
    handle_logging
  end
end
</code></pre>
and the some tests group for this module:<br/>
<pre><code>
describe LoggableModel
  it "should be loggable" do
    LoggableModel.should ...
  end
end</code></pre>
Now, we have a tested code that is going to be used in many cases like this:<br/>
<pre><code>class MyModel
  include LoggableModel
  def after_save
    do_some_other_thing
  end
end</code></pre>

OK, let's see what we have: after_save in MyModel overwrites after_save in LoggableModel and breaks the logging. This is simplest example when the behavior inheritance may be broken. Rspec shared examples groups allows you to ensure that the code in LoggableModel is used correctly from any inherited class. Let's change the definithin of LoggableModel tests.<br/>
<pre><code>
shared_examples_for "logged model" do
  it "should be loggable" do
    subject.should...
  end
end
</code>
</pre>
'Subject' is the ultimate RSpec magic that let us make a simple abstraction with the tested class and reuse these shared examples in MyModel spec:
<pre>
<code>describe MyModel do
  it_should_behave_like 'loggable model'
end</code>
</pre>
In this way we will rerun the LoggableModel examples for MyModel and make sure that it's behavior wasn't broken.

<!--
<br/><br/>
Programming basics like conditions, variables, cycles and functions are mandatory for everyone just like writing and speaking for a baby.<br/> 

But more advanced knowledge are less useful and optional. All of these:
<ul>
	<li>Object hierarchy</li>
	<li>Normalized database model</li>
</ul>
are turned into dust by more important
<ul>
	<li>Do it as fast as possible</li>
	<li>Customer wants!</li>
</ul>

Each framework declare it's own way to organize the application Classes. If you are working on CRUD(create-read-update-delete) data application you don't need to think about object hierarchy yourself anymore. All you need to do is understand where you need place the function that handle data processing. And the principles a well declined in the framework manual. 
Normalized database is only a myth in a real world application. In 80% of cases the database design is evident to the developer. In other 20% the database couldn't be normalized at all.<br/>
<br/>

When you start learning programming try to let your knowledge be "moved to production" as fast as possible. In other words: Have a programming practice as fast as possible and you will understand what kind of programming theory you really need. Concentrate your education on all cases you met and avoid learning things that you could possible come across.

        </h2>
        When you are skilled Unit tests writer it is not very easy to estimate the potential of BDD. Moreover in most cases BDD is used as a human-readable wrapper for unit tests. Do you really think that programmers need such abstract layer? Of course not... Users needs them.<br/>
<!--
<hr/>

Saying Users I mean every non technical person who will treat to application quality some how.
Featured innovation of BDD is <strong>User Stories</strong> - a human-readable bit of specification with technical test implementation behind it. <br/>
Let's review the following example from the blog specification:
<pre><code>
  Given I signed up as Author
    When I write article "TDD and BDD"
    And text of article is "BDD is ...."
    And I post article
    Then I should see "Article is created"
    And I should see article title "TDD and BDD"
</code></pre>
As you can see unlike TDD human readability is the term that was brought to the high priority in BDD. But that is not yet a BDD story.<br/>
We need the programming implementation for each phrase in the story, like this:
<pre><code>
"I signed up as Author":
     signInAsAuthor();
</code></pre>

Programmer's task is to chose the implementation that will validate described behavior. User doesn't know about any programming back end of the story. When the test failed he just knows that some behavior of the application is not working properly any more. <br/>
From this point of view the key principle of user story implementation is that it should <strong>guarantee</strong> with the most high probability that the user can complete described actions.<br/> 

Therefore user stories are the most productive when the implementation is done using <strong>GUI Robots</strong> like SWT bot, Selenium.

            <div class="date">02 Jun 2009</div>
        </h2>
        When I start learning SQL I have to write a lot of nested queries when working on complex select statements from a single table. Now, I feel more comfortable with it and show how to avoid nesting. There are cases when you have to compare one row of the table with all others to get the result:
<ul>
	<li>Select next  element to current by the value of some field</li>
	<li>Select records that are unique by some complex expression</li>
	<li>Select all records that have the same parameter as given record.</li>
</ul>
You can get rid of nesting in all above cases. Let's review the example.
<!--

<hr />Let's say we have the list of elements in `elements` table and we have the id of some element in this table. Now we have to get the next element from the list ordered by `sort_field`.
That could be easily done with the nested select statement:
<pre>
<code>select * from elements e 
where e.sort_field >= 
            (select * from elements where element_id = #value#) and
         e.element_id != #value#
order by e.sort_field limit 1;
</code>
</pre>
Looks not very cool.
Let's do the select statement from `element` table twice to avoid nesting:
<pre><code>-- The e1 is the result row and e2 is a helper row 
--that was picked up using nested select previously.
select e1.* from elements e1, elements e2
--conditional statement will look like
where e1.sort_field &gt;= e2.sort_field and 
     e1.element_id != e2.element_id and 
     e2.element_id = #value#
