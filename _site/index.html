    <a href='/2011/04/javascript-injection-in-json-inserted-directly-into-script-tag'>JavaScript injection in JSON inserted directly into script tag</a>
  </h2>
  Pass data from backend to javascript is done in many different ways. One of the most simple is to inject(&lt;%= %&gt;) value as function argument inside of script tag. Unfortunately this pattern has well known XSS vulnerability but in a little different form than same injection in html template.
<!--more-->
<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    App.initizalizeSomething(<%= data.to_json %>)
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

The reason is that browser treat <strong>&lt;/script&gt;</strong> as close script tag no matter where is it inserted into script. So, the script tag can be closed unexpectedly and opened again with any code if the <em>data</em> argument will contain correctly formed sequence, like:
<pre><code>&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert('hello')&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

Use <em>#html_escape</em> helper is wrong here because it has different type of escaping.
For example you don't need to escape double quote in this case.

Rails core team is aware of that problem and implemented special helper:
<pre><code>    # A utility method for escaping HTML entities in JSON strings
    # using \uXXXX JavaScript escape sequences for string literals:
    #
    #   json_escape("is a &gt; 0 &amp; a < 10?")
    #   # => is a \u003E 0 \u0026 a \u003C 10?
    #
    # Note that after this operation is performed the output is not
    # valid JSON. In particular double quotes are removed:
    #
    #   json_escape('{"name":"john","created_at":"2010-04-28T01:39:31Z","id":1}')
    #   # => {name:john,created_at:2010-04-28T01:39:31Z,id:1}
    #
    # This method is also aliased as +j+, and available as a helper
    # in Rails templates:
    #
    #   <%=j @person.to_json %>
    #

  <h2>
    <a href='/2011/03/ajax-jquery-debug-javascript'>Debug ajax requests in more easy way</a>
  </h2>
  When I have to debug ajax requests, I always feel pain in the ass accessing the exception message and backtrace. It require at least 3 clicks to get them and only in the plain html format, that web framework use to generate. Is it better to see it at once in the browser popup?  
<!--more-->
<br/><br/>
This can be done with Ajax callbacks offered by javascript framework(if yours doesn't - get rid of it). We can catch errors there and display popup. JQuery example with #ajaxError callback that fires on every unsuccessful ajax call:
<pre><code>(function() {
      var popup = null;
      $(document).ajaxError(function(event, xhr, settings, exception) {
        if (popup) {
          popup.close();
          popup = null;
        }
        popup = window.open(null, "error", "width=800,height=600");
        $(popup.document.documentElement).html(xhr.responseText);
        return true;
      });
    }());</code></pre>

Checked in FF and Chrome(IE is not a browser).
<a href="http://img6.imagebanana.com/img/drl8wpd9/screenshot_014.png">Screenshot</a> with the result. Be aware of browser popup blocker. <br/>
You always have a control when popup the error. I like it to be "in any case". But You can customize it with <em>xhr.status</em> and <em>if</em> statement on the server side.
<br/><br/>
In some cases it might be useful not only in the development but in production as well. But it should be an iframe inside of pretty html layout, so that designers won't blame programmers too much.

  <h2>
    <a href='/2010/11/dynamic-context-in-rspec-dont-repeat-yourself'>Dynamic context in Rspec - don't repeat yourself</a>
  </h2>
  Advanced rspec features allow to use very effective technique to organize tests. You are able to construct and define context in more flexible way than before.
We use to have less problems with subject and behavior. And <strong>context</strong> is what testing is all about. Just because web apps manage data, behavior seriously depends on current state of the database. 
<!--more-->
<br/><br/>

Well organized contexts makes a real problem of testing. Unlike TestUnit, Rspec examples may have nested contexts and even dynamic contexts with the <em>let</em> feature. <br/>
In spite of lazy initialization let blocks they are defined before <em>before each</em> hook. Understand by example. <br/> <br/>
In this example orders should be delivered to confirmed customer account just after creation and should not be delivered if the account is not confirmed yet.
<pre><code>describe Order do
  context "after create" do #defining a partial context
    before(:each) do
      subject.customer.confirmed = confirmed
      subject.save!
    end

    context "when customer is confirmed" do 
      let(:confirmed) { true }
      it { should be_delivered }
    end
    
    context "when customer is not confirmed" do 
      let(:confirmed) { false }
      it { should_not be_delivered }
    end
  end
end</code></pre>

Here you can see the partial context definition and custom behavior in two nested context.
We can call not yet declared function and define it later and differently in different contexts.<br/> <br/>

Another example that is kind of pattern matching(erlang term), designed to test utility functions.<br/>
Suppose we have a boolean expression evaluation function:
<pre><code>describe Expression
  describe ".run" do

    subject { Expression.run(arg) }

    context "with '&' where both true" do
      let(:arg) { "true & true" }
      it {should be_true}
    end

    context "with '&' where one false" do
      let(:arg) { "false & true" }
      it {should be_false}
    end
    ........
  end
end</code></pre>

Very good strategy to run same function with different arguments.
<br/> <br/>
Rspec is far ahead of all unit testing frameworks. Unlike most of Rspec clones (e.g. for other programming languages), Rspec authors got in deep to the testing problems and invent flexible and elegant syntax.

  </h2>
  All of us are using passwords and most of us are typing them several times a day. And everyone knows the criteria to generate a good password. Random passwords are very strong from protection point of view but not from usability point of view. 
No body think about password unforgettable-ness and less-painful-to-type-ness. I saw many passwords that are very painful because they are just random. 

And I think it's nice to lose some randomness and make it easier to type and remember.
There is still a lot of enough strong passwords that match this criteria as well. 
<br/><br/>
Try to type and remember something like:

Instead of:

  <h2>
    <a href='/2010/08/populate-db-pattern-fake-data'>Populate database pattern - why is it so cool?</a>
  </h2>
  Once my co-worker propose an idea to fill database with some fake data because we didn't have a  gui forms yet and we have to show something that works to customer. That was a start for great pattern - <strong>populator</strong>.
<!--more-->

<h3>Advantages</h3>
Later we didn't drop that functionality because it was helpful for everyone to always see what's new appear in application. And we find more and more useful aspects of having populator. It was so easy to attach new people to project because we deliver a short set of data within a source code that demonstrates everything we have in our app. Now whole team has a full data set and see if any page doesn't work because of a side effect. Frontend people feel more comfortable with populator because they don't care of how to create many assets in order to see pagination and things like that . Also UI issues became easier to detect because every element present on a screen for every person letting him detect browser specific bugs. 

<h3> Implementation</h3>

I won't recommend any specific library to populate the db except the one to generate fake(Lorem ipsum) content. We prefer <a href="http://github.com/stympy/faker">Faker</a> but that is up to personal choice.
Important note is that inserting data directly into db is bad idea because all application logic is ignored in this case: validation will be ignored and counters cache might be broken. That is why Populate gem is not recommended.<br/><br/>
One nice improvement we made is pass _SCALE_ parameter to populator in order to control how many objects should be generated. Use minimal amount if you need to test that populator works and regular amount to get working system.<br/>
Another good idea is soft save(ignore if not valid) and output the number of created objects after at the end. This letting you if something went wrong during populate process.<br/>
<br/>
Here is an example of how it may look like:
<pre><code>User.transaction do
  # apply the SCALE parameter to the argument. 
  # Default SCALE is 10 so 10 * 1 = 10. 
  # Generate 10 users by default
  scale(1).times do 
    user = User.new
    user.email = Faker::Internet.email
    user.first_name = Faker::Name.first_name
    user.last_name = Faker::Name.last_name
    user.password = user.password_confirmation = 'monkey'
    user.save # this may be false in case of uniqueness restriction or other problems
  end
end


users = User.all
puts "Users: #{users.count}" # make sure we actually made some users </code></pre>

<h3>At the end</h3>
I beleive that Populator should be a part of the build of every project. Yes, it needs some support but in fact it saves lots and lots of time.

    <a href='/2010/07/bdd-rspec-matcher-to-test-named_scope-scoped-rails-3'>Ultimate rspec matcher to test named_scope or scoped</a>
  </h2>
  After having a good practice on using <a href="http://gusiev.com/2010/06/ultimate-rspec-matcher-to-test-validation/">Ultimate rspec matcher to test validation</a> I think it's time to implement one for testing named scopes - custom finders. Testing these finders is daily task. Here is how it can be done with minimum amount of code and maximum readability.
<!--more-->
<h3>Discovery <del>(Animal Planet)</del></h3>

What do we expect from the custom finder?
We expect that it should find assets A, B, C and should not find assets D, E, F.
And sometimes the order is important: it should find A, B C with exact order.

With respect to <em>let</em> rspec feature let's take an example: Product has and belongs to many categories. We need to have a scope to filter products within the specified category:

<pre><code>describe "#by_category_id" do
      let(:given_category) do 
        Factory.create(:given_category)
      end
 

      let(:product_in_given_category) do
        Factory.create(
          :product,
          :categories => [category]
        )
      end

      let(:product_not_in_given_category) do
        Factory.create(
          :product,
          :categories => [Factory.create(:category)]
        )
      end

      # This might be tricky to redefine subject as the finder result
      # but in this way we can delegate the matcher to subject and 
      # avoid writing test descriptions.
      subject { Product.by_category_id(given_category.id) }

      it { should discover(product_in_given_category) }
      it { should_not discover(product_not_in_given_category) }

    end
</code></pre> 

Factory girl was used in this example because factories kickass when we test finders. As you can see the example has a perfect readability with no one line of plain English text. I didn't include the description in my examples but you can easily make them if they make sense for you.<br/>
Note: Be aware of the lazy loading of your finder. <em>let</em> is initialized lazy too. You should make sure it is called before the actual query to the database.
If you don't want to care about lazy loading their is <em>let!</em> method that could be easily copy-pasted from Rspec 2.0. Unlike <em>let</em> it doesn't have lazy initialization:
<pre><code>def let!(name, &block)
  let(name, &block)
  before { __send__(name) } 
end
</code></pre>

<h3>Testing sort order</h3>

If the ordering is done in non-trivial way let's <em>discover.with_exact_order</em>. 
<pre><code>describe "#most_commented named scope" do
  let(:uncommented_post) { Factory.create(:post)}
  let!(:less_commented_post) { Factory.create(:post, :comments => [Factory.build(:comment)])}
  let!(:more_commented_post) { 
    Factory.create(:post, :comments => [Factory.build(:comment), Factory.build(:comment)])}
  }

  subject { described_class.most_commented }
 it {should discover(more_commented_post, less_commented_post).with_exact_order }
 it {should_not discover(uncommented_post) }
end</code></pre>

Be careful with default order. MySQL and Postgres sort objects as they were created by default.
That is why generate objects in reverse order e.g. <em>less_commented_post</em> before <em>more_commented_post</em> is important to make sure that ordering is your code behavior rather than default db behavior.
 
<h3> Summary </h3>
I 've add this matcher to the <a href="http://gusiev.com/2010/06/ultimate-rspec-matcher-to-test-validation/">previous one</a>. Both matchers are available here <a href="http://github.com/bogdan/accept_values_for">accept_values_for</a>. Let's start thinking of what else we can do.

  
    <div class='postpreviewseparator'></div>
  

  <h2>
    <a href='/2010/06/ultimate-rspec-matcher-to-test-validation'>Ultimate rspec matcher to test validation</a>
  </h2>
  After a first thousand of tests using Rspec I fount it very annoying to repeat my self testing the standard code as spec code is usually twice longer than code it test. I've started to look for a way to simplify the patterns and make it reusable. Among other nice rspec tricks there is possibility to write custom Rspec matchers. Spec the validation is just two lines of code for each attribute now.
<!--more-->


<h3> Existing solutions </h3>
After doing some search around I found Shoulda and remarkable gems that provide a way of doing this. Here is one of remarkable variant (others are just ugly): 
<pre><code>it { should validate_numericality_of(:age, :greater_than => 18, :only_integer => true) }</code></pre>
But that is huge contradiction with BDD methodology because it doesn't make you think about behavior. People use to copy-paste code from model to spec and all possible bugs within. As the result <strong>nothing is tested</strong>... I don't even say about "test first".

<h3> Easy DSL and Implementation </h3>
When I implement validation everything I care about is: what values should be accepted and what values should not. An easy DSL that realize this pattern would be:
<pre><code>describe User do
  it { should accept_values_for(:email, “john@example.com”, “lambda@gusiev.com”) }
  it { should_not accept_values_for(:email, “invalid”, nil, “a@b”, “john@.com”) }
end</code></pre> 
That's it! Two lines of code per attribute. And that is perfectly fine for "test first" principle.<br/>
Rspec authors take care about custom Rspec matcher. So the implementation is very easy.
Fork me on github: <a href="http://github.com/bogdan/accept_values_for">accept_values_for rpec matcher</a>. The <strong>accept_values_for</strong> pattern is a true BDD way and unlike Remarkable it really do testing.

<h3> validates_uniqueness_of </h3> 
This is very special validation because you always need more then one record to test it. So, the pattern for uniqueness validation is:
<pre><code>describe User do
  context "if user with email 'aa@bb.com' exists" do
    before do
      User.create!(@valid_attributes.merge(:email => 'aa@bb.com')
    end
    it { should_not accept_values_for(:email, “aa@bb.com”) }
  end
end</code></pre>
<h3> Summary </h3>
Custom matcher is just 50 lines of code that make your life much easier. Do not scare to write your own. Custom matcher to test ActiveRecord#named_scope coming soon.

  <h2>
    <a href='/2010/06/nesting-namespace-route-non-flat-controllers-hierarchy-rails'>Advanced non-flat controllers hierarchy with rails</a>
  </h2>
  REST became the best practice for organizing CRUD server side interface. 
But what to do when we have something more than hello-world application that 
goes forward from data CRUD and provides many presentations 
of the same data with different filters and different layouts?<br/>
<!--more-->

<h3>How the flat controller architecture goes to hell</h3>

Starting from REST-full controller people use to stick to them and add more and more actions to the same class. And that is how the controller code goes to hell:

<pre><code>class UsersController &lt; ApplicationController
#
# Filters
#
skip_before_filter :check_user_is_valid, :only =&gt; [:edit, :update]
before_filter :require_user, :only =&gt; [
:update, :edit, :settings, :disconnect_twitter, :connect_facebook_account, :google_contacts
]

before_filter :load_user, :except =&gt; [
:index, :new, :create, :remote_validate_email, :autocomplete_for_user_full_name,
:remote_validate_facebook_uid, :google_contacts
]

before_filter :check_permissions, :only =&gt; [ :edit, :update, :settings, :update_photo, :connect_facebook_account ]

before_filter :load_invitation, :only =&gt; [:new, :create]
before_filter :ensure_authenticated_to_facebook, :only =&gt; :connect_facebook_account
before_filter :initialize_form, :only =&gt; [:edit]

#
# And 20 almost independent actions goes here
# And the twice longer tests file for this controller
#

end
</code></pre>

<h3> Namespaces and nesting </h3>
The root of the problem is in ignoring the following simple rule:
<strong>The default choice for implementing new feature is do it in other controller</strong>
It's always better to have 20 controllers with one action then one controller with 20 actions.
Usually there is no compromise variant. And 20 controllers with one action ain't as bad as you imagine.<br/>
<br/>

In order to handle the large number of controller we are actively using the namespaces and nested resources features. Let me give an example: User has many projects, Project belongs to category. We need to list projects per user and per category. In the flat hierarchy you would be confused but namespaces and nesting solves the problem.<br/>

<pre><code>map.resources :categories do |c|
  c.namespace :categories do |categories|
    categories.resouces :projects
  end
end
map.resources :users do |u|
  c.namespace :users do |users|
    users.resouces :projects
  end
end

class Categories::ProjectsController

  def index
    @projects = ....
  end
end

class Users::ProjectsController

  def index
    @projects = ....
  end
end</code></pre>


Everyone heard about restful authentication but not so many people applied this idea to other not so restful from the first sight things. Like TwitterConnectionController:

<pre><code>class Users::TwitterConnectionController < ApplicationController

  def create
  end

  def destroy
  end
end</code></pre>

Many people will be pushing all such staff to UsersController until their editors would run out of memory.

<h3>Out of scope</h3>

State control actions are not in REST but should be one day. Placing them in the same controller with CRUD is generally a good idea:

<pre><code>class ArticlesController 

  def {new, create, update, edit, destroy}
  end

  def publish
    @article.publish!
    redirect_to articles_path
  end

end</code></pre>

<h3>Some sugar from generators</h3>

Rails <em>generate</em> script supports namespaces very well:
<pre><code>$ ./script/generate <del>rspec_</del>controller users/categories
      create  app/controllers/users

And classes created in appropriate namespace and folder as well as specs for them.
The only one thing you should do manually is add routes. 

<h3>Drawbacks</h3>

Every engeneering solution has it's drawbacks. While you have different controllers that operates on the same classes you might need to reuse functionality among them.
I preffer to solve it by mixing in a module:
<pre><code>class Users::ProjectController

 include UserNestedResource

end</code></pre>

Some people use inheritance instead. Both ways are almost the same. Nothing hard here as well.

<h3>Summary</h3>

At the end I 'll just repeat it again:<br/> 
Default policy for placing two actions that has some kind of connection is <strong>SPLIT</strong>.

    <a href='/2010/04/dom-element-class-html-javascript-reference'>DOM element class - css reference or javascript reference?</a>
  </h2>
  Designer have used element class attribute for CSS styling for ages. Nowadays classes are also used in javascript selectors. This overlapping cause additional problems: Changes in js may cause broken design and changes in design may cause broken js. The last one may be hard to detect especially when design and css are handled by different person.
<!--more-->
<hr/>
Element class seems the best way to query the element from DOM in js code. Other variants like it's relative possition to other elements are very fragile. Let's say that we have the following DOM:
<pre><code>&lt;a&gt; Delete&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a&gt; Edit&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
And both links are handled with javascript. How would you separate them? 
<ul>
	<li><strong>By order</strong>(first, second) will cause problems if designer would like to change the order.</li>
	<li><strong>By id</strong> will fail if you would have a list of elements where each has these links</li>
	<li><strong>By label</strong> is just a fuck up and won't work for multi language application</li>
</ul>
The only one variant that provide the best stability is reference <strong>By class</strong>.
But as stated above class also serves for another purpose - styling. 

The thing that might help is a special prefix(for example "js") for all 'JavaScript classes'.
Like:
<pre><code>&lt;a class="js-new-comment big-blue-button"&gt; New Comment &lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>

And the convention that classes with prefix should only be used in javascript selectors and classes without prefix in CSS.
<br/><br/>
Yes, sometimes it may look like:
<pre><code>&lt;input type='button' class="js-follow-button follow-button"&gt; Follow this person &lt;/input&gt;</code></pre>
But that makes sense to eliminate maintenance problem described above.

  <h2>
    <a href='/2010/04/ruby18-private-protected-incapsulatio'>Ruby1.8: 'private' doesn't give expected level of privacy</a>
  </h2>
  The classic OOP pattern usually called encapsulation implemented in ruby with <em>private</em> and <em>protected</em> <del>keywords</del> methods. The distinction between API and implementation works great with both. The problem is that <em>private</em> doesn't hide method for inherited classes. 
<!--more-->
<hr/>
See the simple example below:

<pre><code>
class A
  private
  def implementation
    puts 'private A'
  end
end

class B < A
  def api
    implementation
  end
end

B.new.api
</code></pre>

And we won't get exception at the last line.<br/>
The real difference between protected and private methods is more specific.<br/>
At first: <em>implementation</em> method can not be called like <em>self.implementation</em> even from class A.
<pre><code>class A
  def api
    self.implementation #exception here
  end
  private
  def implementation
    puts 'private A'
  end
end

A.new.api
</code></pre>
Seamless pure gap. You can do such call if the method would be protected. Can't imagine the case when this limitation is useful. <br/>
<br/>
The second difference is a bit esoteric. Two instances of the same class can access protected methods of each other but not private methods.

<pre><code>class A
  def api(another) #suppose to receive an instance of a
    implementation == another.implementation
  end
  protected
  def implementation
    puts 'private A'
  end
end
A.new.api(A.new)
</code></pre>
Fine for <em>protected</em> but fail for <em>private</em>. Well, this kind of protection do not make a real because of it's rareness.
<br/><br/>

You might do any decision on the points above.<br/>
My conclusion is to not use <em>private</em> at all, because it doesn't give the level of privacy that I expect. <em>private</em> is not suitable for such an extremely dynamic language as Ruby.

    <a href='/2010/01/sql-queries-activerecord-rails-named-scopes-stack'>Advanced SQL and named scopes stack with ActiveRecord</a>
  </h2>
  If you ever work with rails application that is a little bit more complex then a simple CRUD you would know that some of the ActiveRecord magic doesn't work for complex SQL queries. I am primary talking about named scopes stack feature.<br/>
<!--more-->
<hr/>
Let's review the following named_scope that suppose to be usable in different combinations with others:
<pre><code>named_scope :network_of, lambda {|user|
{
:select => "u.*"
:from => "users u, followings f1, followings f2",
:conditions => "f1.follower_id = #{user.id} AND " + 
"f1.followed_id = f2.follower_id AND " +
"f2.followed_id = u.id"
}</code></pre>
It suppose to returns all people that are followed by people that are followed by the given person.
From the SQL point of view that is the simpliest and fastest way to do that with a plain SQL.
But this solution will have some issues with Active Record named scopes stack magic.
See that User.network_for(current_user).all(:limit =>5) will result in SQL exception primary because (:limit => 5) doesn't know about the table alias "users u".
We can not use it in fact.<br/>
The second problem comes to the foreground when we will try to use ActiveRecord features like
User.network_for(current_user).all(:include => :orders). ActiveRecord handles :include in the very different ways and in some cases you will see the SQL exception here as well.<br/>
The problem is that :include sometimes appends some joins to the query that is concatenated to the last table in the :from parameter. To solve that we should make "users" table to be the last one declared in :from parameter.
<pre><code>:select => "users.*"
:from => "followings f1, followings f2, users",
:conditions => "f1.follower_id = #{user.id} AND " + 
"f1.followed_id = f2.follower_id AND " +
"f2.followed_id = users.id"</code></pre>
Summary I would say that using :joins instead of :from/:conditions would give more flexibility and stackability to your named scopes but sometimes :from is more clear and here you got the tip how to use it.

  </h2>
  I was using Vim to do the minor editing in config files for ages. Vim is advanced on basic navigation and editing operations. However I was always prefer IDE for programming because of it's specific to language navigation('go to definition' feature is awesome!), integrated debugger. But while gaining the experience I noticed that all advanced features began to be less important then basic ones. And you should try Vim if you feel the same.<br/>
<!--more-->
<hr/>

The basic concept of vim is that: Vim think in the same way as you do. For example: I want to delete 'd' everything inside 'i' brackets ')' and vim understands my command: di) <br/>
You shouldn't type a dozen of button to move cursor around and finally delete the selected fragment. 
It's hard to adapt because people are use to think in the way that there text editor do. Vim does vice versa. Some people are saying that they don't like vim because it make them think a lot. That's wrong! Vim is trying to make you free from thinking about editing and concentrate on the content.<br/>

General editing in Vim considered up to every small details. Ask yourself if there is some usual task that I am doing inefficiently and search the Vim feature to optimize that in 3-5 keys. And in ninety nine percent of cases you will find it as built in vim command or a plugin.

  <h2>
    <a href='/2009/10/objects-behaviour-inheritance-with-rspec'>Objects behaviour inheritance with RSpec</a>
  </h2>
  About half of a year ago I was writing about <a href="http://gusiev.com/2009/05/what-do-you-expect-from-interface/">object interface and Liskov Substitution Princeple</a>. In short: Any class instance that extends the base class should pass all <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">unit tests</span> behaviour tests written for base class instance. It was a surprise for me that this concept has already been implemented in RSpec.<br/><br/>

<!--more-->
My previous article was primary inspired by Java programming language and it's interface concept. Unlike Java, Ruby does not have interfaces, but behaviour inheritance is still actual for both languages. RSpec seems the first testing framework that provide the ability to validate LSP and behavior inheritance with 'it_should_behave_like'. <br/>
With Ruby modules(mixins) feature we can build reusable code and include it in different classes<a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Module.html">(read more)</a>. With RSpec we can bundle the tests as well.<br/>

<br/>

Let's review the following module that uses one of the Rails callback and adds some logging:<br/>
<pre>
<code>
module LoggedModel
  def after_save
    super
    handle_logging
  end
end
</code>
</pre>
and the some tests group for this module:<br/>
<pre><code>
describe LoggableModel
  it "should be loggable" do
    LoggableModel.should ...
  end
end
</code>
</pre>
Now, we have a tested code that is going to be used in many cases like this:<br/>
<pre><code>class MyModel
  include LoggableModel
  def after_save
    do_some_other_thing
  end
end
</code></pre>

OK, let's see what we have: after_save in MyModel overwrites after_save in LoggableModel and breaks the logging. This is simplest example when the behavior inheritance may be broken. Rspec shared examples groups allows you to ensure that the code in LoggableModel is used correctly from any inherited class. Let's change the definithin of LoggableModel tests.<br/>
<pre><code>
shared_examples_for "logged model" do
  it "should be loggable" do
    subject.should...
  end
end
</code>
</pre>
'Subject' is the ultimate RSpec magic that let us make a simple abstraction with the tested class and reuse these shared examples in MyModel spec:
<pre>
<code>describe MyModel do
  it_should_behave_like 'loggable model'
end</code>
</pre>
In this way we will rerun the LoggableModel examples for MyModel and make sure that it's behavior wasn't broken.

<br/><br/>
Programming basics like conditions, variables, cycles and functions are mandatory for everyone just like writing and speaking for a baby.<br/> 

But more advanced knowledge are less useful and optional. All of these:
<ul>
	<li>Object hierarchy</li>
	<li>Normalized database model</li>
</ul>
are turned into dust by more important
<ul>
	<li>Do it as fast as possible</li>
	<li>Customer wants!</li>
</ul>

Each framework declare it's own way to organize the application Classes. If you are working on CRUD(create-read-update-delete) data application you don't need to think about object hierarchy yourself anymore. All you need to do is understand where you need place the function that handle data processing. And the principles a well declined in the framework manual. 
Normalized database is only a myth in a real world application. In 80% of cases the database design is evident to the developer. In other 20% the database couldn't be normalized at all.<br/>

When you start learning programming try to let your knowledge be "moved to production" as fast as possible. In other words: Have a programming practice as fast as possible and you will understand what kind of programming theory you really need.

    <a href='/2009/06/bdd-user-stories-productive-tdd-criticism'>When BDD user stories is productive</a>
  </h2>
  When you are skilled Unit tests writer it is not very easy to estimate the potential of BDD. Moreover in most cases BDD is used as a human-readable wrapper for unit tests. Do you really think that programmers need such abstract layer? Of course not... Users needs them.<br/>
<!--more-->
<hr/>

Saying Users I mean every non technical person who will treat to application quality some how.
Featured innovation of BDD is <strong>User Stories</strong> - a human-readable bit of specification with technical test implementation behind it. <br/>
Let's review the following example from the blog specification:
<pre>
<code>
  Given I signed up as Author
    When I write article "TDD and BDD"
    And text of article is "BDD is ...."
    And I post article
    Then I should see "Article is created"
    And I should see article title "TDD and BDD"
</code>
</pre>
As you can see unlike TDD human readability is the term that was brought to the high priority in BDD. But that is not yet a BDD story.<br/>
We need the programming implementation for each phrase in the story, like this:
<pre>
<code>
"I signed up as Author":
     signInAsAuthor();
</code>
</pre>

Programmer's task is to chose the implementation that will validate described behavior. User doesn't know about any programming back end of the story. When the test failed he just knows that some behavior of the application is not working properly any more. <br/>
From this point of view the key principle of user story implementation is that it should <strong>guarantee</strong> with the most high probability that the user can complete described actions.<br/> 

Therefore user stories are the most productive when the implementation is done using <strong>GUI Robots</strong> like SWT bot, Selenium.

    <a href='/2009/06/avoid-nested-select-double-single-table-complex-query'>Double select from a single table in complex SQL query.</a>
  </h2>
  When I start learning SQL I have to write a lot of nested queries when working on complex select statements from a single table. Now, I feel more comfortable with it and show how to avoid nesting. There are cases when you have to compare one row of the table with all others to get the result:
<ul>
	<li>Select next  element to current by the value of some field</li>
	<li>Select records that are unique by some complex expression</li>
	<li>Select all records that have the same parameter as given record.</li>
</ul>
You can get rid of nesting in all above cases. Let's review the example.
<!--more-->

<hr />Let's say we have the list of elements in `elements` table and we have the id of some element in this table. Now we have to get the next element from the list ordered by `sort_field`.
That could be easily done with the nested select statement:
<pre>
<code>select * from elements e 
where e.sort_field >= 
            (select * from elements where element_id = #value#) and
         e.element_id != #value#
order by e.sort_field limit 1;
</code>
</pre>
Looks not very cool.
Let's do the select statement from `element` table twice to avoid nesting:
<pre>
<code>-- The e1 is the result row and e2 is a helper row 
--that was picked up using nested select previously.
select e1.* from elements e1, elements e2
--conditional statement will look like
where e1.sort_field >= e2.sort_field and 
     e1.element_id != e2.element_id and 
     e2.element_id = #value#
-- and the end of the query remains almost the same
order by e1.sort_field limit 1
</code>
</pre>

Do not scare of double select from single table. That is the same technique as if they were different tables.

  </h2>
  A lot of relational tables need created and update timestamps columns. I prefer having them for all tables with no exception. However, most of applications I am working on are running MySQL. MySQL has minor limitation on timestamps. Unfortunately you can create only one time stamp column that has <em> DEFAULT NOW()</em> value. Read more to see how to avoid this limitation. <!--more-->
<hr/>
The simplest way to do this is create the following columns in the table:
<div class="bordered"><code>stamp_created timestamp default now(), 
stamp_updated timestamp default now() on update now()) </code></div>
But MySQL will return the following error: <br/> 
<em>ERROR 1293 (HY000): Incorrect table definition; there can be only one TIMESTAMP column with CURRENT_ in DEFAULT or ON UPDATE clause</em> <br/>
You can use only one of the definitions in one table. However here is the way how to create both timestamps columns:
<pre><code> create table test_table( 
id integer not null auto_increment primary key, 
stamp_created timestamp default '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 
stamp_updated timestamp default now() on update now() 
); </code></pre>
Note that it is necessary to enter nulls into both columns during ‘insert’:
<pre><code> mysql&gt; insert into test_table(stamp_created, stamp_updated) values(null, null); 
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.06 sec)
mysql&gt; select * from t5; 
+----+---------------------+---------------------+ 
| id | stamp_created       | stamp_updated       |

+----+---------------------+---------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)  
mysql&gt; update test_table set id = 3 where id = 2; 
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.05 sec) Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0

    <a href='/2009/04/ant-task-to-install-tomcat-service'>Ant task to install tomcat service26px</a>
  </h2>
  If you are familiar to run Apache Tomcat as Windows service, you can install it with the ant task. <i>build.xml</i> file sample under the cut line.
<!--more-->
<hr/>
First of all let's do some properties setup:

<div class="bordered">
<code>
catalina.home=d:/java/tomcat-6.0.18
tomcat.executable=${catalina.home}/bin/tomcat6.exe
tomcat.service.executable=\
${catalina.home}/bin/service.bat
tomcat.service.name=myproject
# parameters that will be used in the jvm
tomcat.service.jvm.ms=128
tomcat.service.jvm.mx=256
</code>
</div>
Service startup task consists of 5 exec commands:
<ul>
	<li>Stop service if currently running</li>
	<li>Delete service if installed</li>
	<li>Install service with bat script</li>
	<li>Update service with some parameters</li>
	<li>Start service</li>
</ul>

Here is the implementation:
<div class="bordered">
<code>

    &lt;target name="tomcat.service.install" description="Install tomcat service"&gt;
        
        &lt;exec command="net stop ${tomcat.service.name}"
              failifexecutionfails="false"
              failonerror="false"/&gt;

        &lt;exec command="${tomcat.executable} //DS//${tomcat.service.name}"
              failifexecutionfails="false"
              failonerror="false"/&gt;
        &lt;exec executable="${tomcat.service.executable}" 
                  failifexecutionfails="true" failonerror="true"&gt;
            &lt;env key="CATALINA_HOME" value="${catalina.home}"/&gt;
            &lt;arg value="install"/&gt;
            &lt;arg value="${tomcat.service.name}"/&gt;
        &lt;/exec&gt;
       &lt;exec executable="${tomcat.executable}"&gt;
            &lt;arg value="//US//${tomcat.service.name}"/&gt;
            &lt;arg value="--JvmMs=${jvm.ms}"/&gt;
            &lt;arg value="--JvmMx=${jvm.mx}"/&gt;
            &lt;arg value="--Startup=auto"/&gt;
        &lt;/exec&gt;
        &lt;exec command="net start ${tomcat.service.name}" 
                  failifexecutionfails="true" failonerror="true"/&gt;
    &lt;/target&gt;



</code>

  <h2>
    <a href='/2009/04/clear-upload-file-input-field'>Clear upload file input field </a>
  </h2>
  Many web developers came to the problem that they are not able to change value of file input field from Java Script in the web application. There is no access to value field of file input tag because of security restriction. However there is a trick how to erase this field if you need it in your application. <br/>
<!--more-->
<hr/>
You can simply redraw the html block where your input tag is located. In this case all data will remain the same except the selected file value.

<pre>
<code>
&lt;div id="uploadFile_div"&gt;
&lt;input type="file" class="fieldMoz" id="uploadFile" 
            onkeydown="return false;" size="40" name="uploadFile"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;a onclick="clearFileInputField('uploadFile_div')" 
                         href="javascript:noAction();"&gt;Clear&lt;/a&gt;
</code>
</pre>
Java Script function below looks strange but acts exactly in the way we want:
<pre>
<code> 
&lt;script&gt;
function clearFileInputField(tagId) {
    document.getElementById(tagId).innerHTML = 
                    document.getElementById(tagId).innerHTML;
}
&lt;/script&gt;
            
</code>
</pre>

  <h2>
    <a href='/2009/04/success-components'>Components of success </a>
  </h2>
  People from different countries are reaching success in completely different way. And that is good because no matter who you are you can be successful. I heard a lot of success stories and now can summarize - what components are required to build your own success story...<br/>
<!--more-->
<br/>
Here are the components:<br/>
<h5> Hard work </h5>
That's it. This is may be the most important one. Don't think you can be successful while sitting on the chair and do nothing. 

<h5> Intellect </h5>
Many people work hard whole life and stay where they are without moving ahead. That is a pity that sometimes hard work is done in the wrong direction. Also try to look several steps ahead and see the perspective of the work you do.

<h5>Risk</h5>
Risk is a very helpful component. You can go the most reliable way.  But in fact add some risk can seriously improve the result. Do something without risk is impossible because there is always a risk that your work is useless.

<h5>Luck</h5>
Yes, that's it. This component is very important. All above components are nothing without luck and there is also some good and bad tricks in our way that we can not forecast.

    <a href='/2009/04/brain-async'>Brain async</a>
  </h2>
  Many people came to the question: Why do our brain is having so many gaps: forget important info, quickly change opinion, stuck when doing usual actions, etc? Well, try to look from the different side.<br/>
Our brain is about 4 million of neurons('processors') that works completely async: neural impulses follow though brain without any rules and permissions, every neuron process the information in there own way, no body is able to re implement such a large information processing system. From this point of gap are normal and true solutions and that is being solved by our brain every day is a miracle.

  There is no one technical book I read more than a half. Is everybody doing this way?
I recommend book authors to explain themselves in more short form.
