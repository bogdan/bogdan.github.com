            <div class="date">23 Nov 2017</div>
        </h2>
        <p>Naming things in software is really a big deal. It gets harder and harder over time when a code base gets larger.
I’ve never encountered an article that would try to address the issue. So here, I will try to define good name criteria as well as naming strategies that appeared to be useful in my experience.</p>

<!--

<h2 id="name-like-your-users-do">Name like your users do</h2>

<p>The most basic idea of giving a thing like class, method or function a good name is to name by how your users suppose to call it.
Like if there is a tweet in twitter I would assume that there should be a thing named “Tweet” inside twitter source code.
It is as simple as it is, but when you model things right your internal infrastructure just reflects the actual interaction between software users. This principle applies well to the structure we call OOD: the right OOD has maximum number of classes that your users can see through software interface and minimum number of classes that your users can not see. And those things that users can see should have their name from how your users call it or would call it.</p>

<p>Good example when things can get a different name:</p>

<p>Lets say we have Article and Email and both of them are having a header. But in the article it is usually called “title” but in the email it is usually called “subject”. If you don’t have any shared code between the two, it is better to stick with different names rather than the same: it will make you closer to how your users call it and will avoid unnecessary naming collision that is described later.</p>

<p>It is worse noting that this is not the only one principle to follow. There can be a number of reasons you may go with a different name rather than the name that comes naturally. They are described below.</p>

<h2 id="avoid-simplifications-through-naming">Avoid simplifications through naming</h2>

<p>If there is some completely new thing that needs to be named for both end users and software, ensure that there is no other thing that has the same name in your software.
Human brain tend to simplify the world around us and use the same name for different things.</p>

<p>Here is a good example:
Suppose your software allows people to subscribe to newsletter and to unsubscribe from email notifications.
In this case, human brain interprets this two possibilities as logically opposite while they are not: there is actually three states the person can have: subscribed to newsletter, unsubscribed from email notifications and undefined (or default); or even 2 independent options with “Yes/No” states. Even though all software developers in your team understand the difference, you can not expect all people in the world to understand that.
In order to avoid the automatic simplification, you’d better call those states: opted in for newsletter (or simply “opted_in” internally) and unsubscribed from email notifications (or simply “unsubscribed” internally).</p>

<p>The idea that “Opted In” should stuck as a term for newsletter subscription and “Unsubscribed” should stuck for email notifications. When people speak fast, they will always shorten those terms. It means that through the daily conversation certain verbs will be used instead of describing the entire action. Example: “How many subscribed people do we have?” will have some uncertainty in case “to subscribe” will be used for both: describing newsletter subscription and notification emails subscription instead of just one.</p>

<h2 id="naming-uniqueness">Naming Uniqueness</h2>

<p>Here is a good example from my practice on how naming uniqueness can be broken:
English has two words “Company” and “Campaign”. In my native tongue they actually translated into a single word: “Компания” /compania/. It is better to just avoid using these both terms for naming in the international team. While this is a rare case, it gives the idea on how naming problem appears: Russian conversation don’t make a difference between 2 things that are pretty different. Same case appears naturally within a single language all the time.</p>

<p>The other source of naming collision can still be a fast speech between team members.
Suppose your software works with “WebPageSnapshot” as well as “ServerSnapshot”
When people speak fast, they will tend to use “Snapshot” for both terms. It can lead to misunderstanding in daily conversation.
The phrase: “I made a patch that touches a snapshot source code, please take a look” doesn’t define the actual place to look at. It will almost certainly lead to time waste from people assumptions they understood each other. Either the speaker or the listener could not be aware that both types of snapshot exist and they may feel natural with the assumption that “Snapshot” can only mean one of the types.
Please only use adjectives to distinguish between terms if they are actually same thing at some level of abstraction like:
“VideoFile” and “ImageFile” are just “File” at some levels in your software (in other words: share code and behaviour).</p>

<p>Using same adjectives to ensure things are connected by their names is a good idea.
Consider the business rule: “Affiliate Member” can participate in “Affiliate Campaign”. 
We will not make any confusion by using same adjective for both terms. Avoiding adjectives in fast conversation will not be that misleading: “The member with email ‘bogdan@example.com’ has joined the campaign 2 days ago”
A business rule like: ‘“Member Affiliate” can participate in “Campaign Affiliate”’ is worse than a weapon of mass destruction for communication inside your team. 
The general rule: ensure that shorten versions of names are easy to use in daily conversations.</p>

<h2 id="naming-internal-objects">Naming internal objects</h2>

<p>What I mean by internal here is a thing that is pretty known inside your software but completely unseen by the end users.
Examples from Rails: “UsersController” or “UsersHelper”</p>

<p>Note that there is no problem in calling every controller like “WhateverController” (with the same suffix) because all of those controllers actually share code and behaviour, so they are the same thing at some basic level while “WebPageSnapshot” and “ServerSnapshot” were not in the previous example.
Some objects are just internal - end users don’t interact with them directly. There are some principles that would allow to give them a good name too.</p>

<p>At first, ensure that internal thing doesn’t take a name of the thing that is actually available to the end users. This is very important to do: leave good names for things your users care most and can interact with.</p>

<p>At second,  it is good to give them a longer names to encode more information on what they do. There could be understanding illusion connected to a name. Internals of your software tend to do some specific work. When you give them a short name, software developers tend to assume they understand what they do. It can be a complete illusion. </p>

<p>At third, sometimes it is even a good idea to give a confusing name to something.
 You may avoid that illusion by giving a name that would cause software developer to never assume what this thing does before looking at it.<br />
 Choose wisely if you want your developers to assume what a method does based on name or not. These assumptions can be misleading for complex cases. In my project, we have a method called <code>def fuck_short_url(text)</code>. It has more comments than lines of code: it makes a very specific replacement of links inside a text fragment and we don’t want any developer to assume they know what it does based on name. Here is the method source code for the most curious readers: <a href="https://gist.github.com/7a823c15ac350aaf948668f0fc3a3238">https://gist.github.com/7a823c15ac350aaf948668f0fc3a3238</a></p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>There could be 3 types of names: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Direct name - like your users call it</li>
  <li>Descriptive name - long and describing the function of an object or method</li>
  <li>Strange Name - eliminates the name based assumption</li>
</ol>

<p>Good principles to follow:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Follow naming that was already given by software users or community/business overall</li>
  <li>Name things uniquely to avoid confusion</li>
  <li>Avoid naming collision through simplification of terms and shortening of actions</li>
  <li>Give longer names to more complex things </li>
  <li>Give shorter names to things that are frequently used</li>
</ol>

            <div class="date">07 Jul 2017</div>
        </h2>
        <p>It is becoming popular to talk about software development principles from time to time. The new major concepts appear and die due to the fact that most of them are designed to be perfect but they are not. If you would stay in IT long enough, you encounter articles and talks where people discovered an amazing concept “X” that solved all their development problems and brought their team to inevitable success. Unfortunately that “permanent success” is usually temporary or even a self-deception. The truth is: there is no silver bullets in software development just like in any other engineering process. Engineering of world class products requires precise resources control, trade offs and balance between easy and complex, fast and slow, and beautiful and ugly. Here, I will try to explain my guiding software development principles as well as the why-s.</p>

<!--

<h2 id="priority-matters">Priority Matters</h2>

<p>We often forget that most principles don’t match not only with the real solutions but also each other: you can not swim and guard clothing at the same time. So first thing you need to consider is priority of your principles. Some of them should be more important than others. In this way you can solve contradiction between them: if there are two principles and they can not be followed at the same time, pick the higher priority one.</p>

<h2 id="less-is-more">Less is More</h2>

<p>There should be very limited number of principles to follow. More principles under the same concept just creates more contradiction and leaves less room to be situational and follow additional guidelines that would fit best for given problem. I think the ideal number in your “guiding principles” that apply <strong>almost</strong> to everything in your software should be 3. Higher numbers are possible. </p>

<p>Christian God was so kind that he left us with 12 that still have very small contradiction like: should I steal a weapon from a person that wants to kill me tomorrow? That’s an amazing result for human moral that is at least 1000x times older than software development. Based on our level of understanding of software engineering, we can effort only 3 at the same time.</p>

<h2 id="build-for-humans">Build for Humans</h2>

<p>Software is always build by humans and for humans. Software should do what it should do in a convenient, fast and robust way. If any principle violates the usefulness of software, it can be only partially followed. And that is fine because principles are imperfect. They should not be taken as dogmas because they are defined imperfectly by imperfect people.</p>

<h2 id="getting-to-the-core">Getting to the core</h2>

<p>So here are principles that guide me through software development sprints as well as through software development marathons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Software should do what it should do.</li>
  <li>Model the real world</li>
  <li>Build an Architecture</li>
  <li>Track Dependencies</li>
</ol>

<p>Lets go through them one by one:</p>

<h2 id="model-the-real-world">1. Model the real world</h2>

<p>This is the most important and genius principles I ever encounter that is even older than computers comes for analogue computers: model the real world.
Try to be as close as possible to the piece of world you are modelling in the software: if there are users of your software, there should be a User in your code. If you simulate an iPhone, there should be an essence of iPhone in your software that performs all of its functions no matter how many of them there are. Also this principle requires you to name things right making them closer to processes they simulate. There will be always a gap between how the process is simulated in software and the real process, but this gap needs to be as close as possible to ensure software does things efficiently. </p>

<p>We tend to think that a software is complex. But the complexity comes from several factors. First is the processes being modeled are complex - here you would need to rethink them to make them simpler. But the second reason is software developer didn’t model them right. If you model things as they are, you eliminate second factor. If you model things even better than they are, you can even eliminate the first factor. It is worth mentioning that is only possible if you have a power to alter the process or the process you are modeling doesn’t exist yet. This is mostly the case for the modern software. If you are about to make a “select your seat” functionality for the plane ticket, there is no way you can simplify plane seat locations. If you make a new e-commerce web site, you are an author of most processes and can make product finding functionality as simple as possible until you reach a fact that it needs to fit not just your needs but also all your users needs which are quite different. </p>

<h2 id="build-an-architecture">2. Build an Architecture</h2>

<p>Architecture is often seen as a luxurius term that can only be understoon and build by an elite part of development team. Sometimes in outsource companies this is given to the team by someone like company CTO that is not even part of the team. But architecture is something more trivial and someone everyone in a team is building. Lets try to define architecture in the most basic way:
Architecture is the code that is used by your software the most number of times.
As you model more and more processes, the code base grows. It needs to be generalized and reused. We all know which problems come from unreused code: bug fixes and changes need to be made more than once that inevitably leads to the lack of consistency in software where buttons that would suppose to do the same thing do it in a slightly or not so slightly different way. But code reuse is more than that: architecture is just a code reuse metric. If you have a code that is easy to reuse, the architecture arises on its own because people tend to reuse existing code instead of writing new. From the other hand, you can measure the “architectureness” of any code piece including third party(aka gems) by counting how many times it is used. That definition is well aligned with the popular idea that architecture is hard to change: if you reuse a particular piece more, it gets harder and harder to change it because the change affects more places. Following this principle also requires a good test coverage. The most reused code is usually the most covered by tests. You can not test everything, but you can define your priority based on number of usages of particular module.</p>

<h2 id="track-dependencies">3. Track Dependencies</h2>

<p>This is the most advanced and the most complex principle of all three. I have heard so many times: “Hey, why couldn’t we just break up our code into reusable modules that are independent?” or “Can we just write many independent micro-services?”. Yes, this is all about real breaking of software into independent pieces. Many theoretical-software-developers think it is a silver bullet, but it is not. Firstly because you violate Principle 1: model the real world. If things are interconnected and mutually dependent in the real world, you can not model them differently. It is a big talent to be able to find those possibilities with the minimum sacrifices of principles 1 and 2 which are more important to follow, but still sometimes violated due to the need of breaking software into independent modules.
It is worse clarifying that there are 3 level of dependencies:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Mutually Dependent</li>
  <li>One-way Dependent</li>
  <li>Independent</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is more formal definition: if you have code blocks A and B, they are totally independent if each block can perform its functions (aka pass all tests written) without other one. They are one-way dependent if A can perform its work without B or vice versa. And, finally, they are mutually dependent if neither can perform its work without another. In most cases, when Rails developers talk about several modules in their app, that is just a bullshit because there is no way one model can perform its work without others. They all are mutually dependent. And this is a very effective design because this is how the real world works: no modules - everything is mutually dependent as much as flowers and bees. You may start modeling pollination process from Bee class and Flower class and even consider them “independent modules” but in a few hours you would end up referencing one from another all the time. </p>

<p>The name of the principle as “Track Dependencies” comes from the fact that there are 3 level of interdependencies and you should at least stop thinking too abstract about them: figure out how much they are dependent and control that. Usually making things completely independent is unnecessary within one application. One-way dependent is good enough. You in-app dependency tree should be based on your vendor libraries dependency tree that is very well defined. You may consider your Gemfile dependency tree as the ideal dependency tree. Maybe you will come along the same structure in your app but it will be 10 times harder due to reasons that are hard to explain in a small article.</p>

<p>There is far more to say about it, but I’ll probably make a dedicated article about “Track Dependencies” later.</p>

<h2 id="software-should-do-what-it-should-do">0. Software should do what it should do.</h2>

<p>As I said earlier. You should always sacrifice principles if you can not build software that meets all the requirements with them.
It is worth admitting that this is due to the fact that you are not a perfect software developer. Maybe the task wants you to be 2x better at software development than you are. And you can not become 2x better in a blink of an eye while your project has deadlines. Most likely you would be able to complete the task following all your principles with infinite resources, but they will not happen any time soon. You need sacrifices due lack of time, brain power, people and restrictions from security, performance, usability and other sources. Those are main reasons that causes the code to look ugly and complex, but never give up the beauty completely.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>There is more to say about each principle above. It lacks examples but it is hard to find good ones that don’t require a lot of context to understand. I’ll write a more detailed article on each principle. Also, even thought the priority of principles is pretty important to follow, there might be exceptions. Exceptions are hard to formalize. You should judge them based on your practical experience and still make an internal note why the priority was changes for a particular case, but not the rest.</p>

        <p>I’ve never been a fan of Single Responsibility Principle aka SRP</p>

<p>If any physical thing I used has multiple responsibilities, why would software be built from SRP things?</p>

<!--

<p>The role of information technology software is to build a model of the outer world. But is there many things in real world that follow SRP?</p>

<p>SRP feels so elegant from the first glance: why isn’t it wonderful that every tool you have does only one specific job. And all your tools are always sharp and you know exactly which tool is designed for what kind of job.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.evansclarke.com.au/Lib/tools.JPG" width="300px" /></p>

<p>Well, in fact even common instruments are usually multifunctional.</p>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Claw-hammer.jpg" width="300px" /></p>

<p>It feels like hammer should be a perfect example of SRP, but it is not. 
Hint: Pay attention to what is on opposite sides of the handle: these are two different ends designed to do completely different job.
It is a good example how solution is done based on the process but not on SRP. SRP is too idealistic even for a hammer.
Convenience requires to merge two instruments into one to make it easy to switch from riving in to pulling out.
It always requires in depth integration of functions into processes. </p>

<p>The pliers show even deeper integration in their design, allowing many processes associated with a wire to be done with using a single tool:</p>

<p>And this multi-functionality factor expands as we move to more complex and famous devices. Like:</p>

<p><img src="http://store.storeimages.cdn-apple.com/4428/as-images.apple.com/is/image/AppleInc/aos/published/images/i/ph/iphone6/plus/iphone6-plus-box-space-gray-2014?wid=478&amp;hei=595&amp;fmt=jpeg&amp;qlt=95&amp;op_sharpen=0&amp;resMode=bicub&amp;op_usm=0.5,0.5,0,0&amp;iccEmbed=0&amp;layer=comp&amp;.v=1411520743411" width="200px" /></p>

<p>Moving into another direction: none of two things on the image below follows SRP.
Both of them are carrying not just an electrical charge, but some mass and spin as well. It tells that their behaviour is described by their electromagnetic and gravitational responsibilities. See that two is still not one.</p>

<p><img src="http://science.jrank.org/article_images/ep201102/science/science982.jpg" /></p>

<p>Same thing happen in software world: utilities are better when designed to support a specific process and classes are made to simulate real world object that have tons of responsibilities.</p>

<p>So next time you blame ActiveRecord::Base for having 200+ methods, try to think how well it is designed to support a CRUD process of a database entity.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>Principles discusses in software development always were very hot mainly because all engineering principles are pretty controversial. But I can definitely say that SRP is one of the most controversial among them.</p>

        </h2>
        <p>Whenever you are serious about choosing the frontend template engine to generate HTML, here is some advice how you can make your choice easier and 
more effective. There are too many template languages right now, but there are only a few main criteria how you can limit your selection to 2-3 of them before
getting into details.</p>

<!--

<p>Here they are:</p>

<h2 id="logic-less-or-with-programming-language">Logic-less OR with Programming language</h2>

<p>The most common way to generate a template that would seem obvious to any developer would be using programming language.
Example: ERB for Ruby, JSP for Java etc.
That is a pretty straight way to implement loops, conditions and more rare view structures.</p>

<p>On the other hand, logic-less templates like Mustache restrict you from using complicated structures in the template forcing you to extract and put them to a different layer.</p>

<p>Example of the same condition in logic-less or programming language template engines:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-erb" data-lang="erb"><span class="cp">&lt;%</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="vi">@user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">posts</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">empty?</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="vi">@user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">comments</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">empty?</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">  &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Delete&lt;/a&gt;</span>
<span class="cp">&lt;%</span> <span class="k">end</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x"></span></code></pre></div>

<p>In logic-less template language, it would look like:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-erb" data-lang="erb"><span class="cp">&lt;%</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">possible_to_delete_user?</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">  &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Delete&lt;/a&gt;</span>
<span class="cp">&lt;%</span> <span class="k">end</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x"></span></code></pre></div>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">possible_to_delete_user?</span>
  <span class="vi">@user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">posts</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">empty?</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="vi">@user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">comments</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">empty?</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div>

<p>That looks more clean but less flexible as the logic-less template forces you to make quality even if you would like to save time instead.</p>

<p>In general I would recommend Logic-Free languages for a huge team with lots of beginner developers that need a strong force — like language restriction — to be controlled.</p>

<h2 id="frontend-rendering-support">Frontend Rendering support</h2>

<p>Frontend rendering can be the ultimate reason to switch to this type of template language. The decision here usually comes from more strong reasons of the application design rather than template language properties.
I will assume that you already know if you want to use frontend rendering or not.
And in case of yes, you would need to think if it is ok to have a single language  for both — front and back end — or a different one for backend rendering.
Two template languages overhead can be not so large overhead sometimes. For example, when the backend templates are only used for static layout like html head, or footer and header of the page, or admin pages.</p>

<p>It is pretty obvious that such a template language needs to use JavaScript in some way even though it is CoffeeScript. </p>

<h2 id="minimalistic-or-html-compatible">Minimalistic OR HTML Compatible</h2>

<p>HTML is being blamed for too ambiguous structures: you should always repeat yourself with closing tags, often used html attributes don’t have shortcuts etc.
Minimalistic template languages are not trying to look like HTML and provide a convenient way to write an XML-like structure.
When I write HAML instead of ERB, my fingers run a significantly smaller distance.</p>

<p>On the other hand, minimalistic templates can be hard to understand for old school software developers that parse HTML on autopilot.
If your team has too many developers like that, then a Minimalistic template engine isn’t worth it.</p>

<h2 id="sandbox-mode-support">Sandbox Mode support</h2>

<p>The Sandbox Mode support requirement is pretty exotic. It is only required if you would like to allow users to change the appearance of site pages significantly
by allowing them to edit the template themselves without modifying the site source code.
Maybe it is not obvious to everyone, but in this case, template language would need to support many limitations to the template source code that will prevent your server from blowing up.
The most trivial example of how a template could blow up a server would be loops nested to each other one hundred times that will consume too many resources.
Sandbox is a super mode of the logic-less template. When not just full power programming language is not allowed, but additional limitations exist to make any possible template safe.
Most popular template languages like ERB, HAML or EJS (just like ERB but Javascript instead of Ruby) don’t support Sandbox. But here are two that do: <a href="http://github.com/shopify/liquid">liquid</a> and <a href="https://github.com/stefankroes/scribble">scribble</a></p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>After a clear answer to what kind of template you need, the choice becomes more obvious as there will be only a few template engines matching given requirements.
I’ve even spent some time letting to build this nice table for you:</p>

<table class="bordered">

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This table doesn’t include all variants, but I’ve tried to fill in as many cells in the last column giving at least 2 variants if possible.</p>

<p>The current software world of Ruby &amp; JavaScript doesn’t give full spectrum of choices when you would like to have Sandbox mode support.
As I said before: Sandbox Mode is very rare requirement.</p>

<p>But in other cases you have enough choices. It is strange that there is no logic-less, frontend and minimalistic template engine now. If there is one - please suggest me in a comment.</p>

        <p>I have tried a bunch of ActiveRecord’s state machine gems.
Their functionality is very close to each other. It allows to validate a state transition
and reinvent ruby programming language to define transition methods.
The fact that all of them produces custom API to define a ruby method doesn’t look right…

<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Maybe I don’t know all modern trends but ruby version looks more human readable to me.</p>

<h3 id="so-why-do-we-still-tend-to-use-state-machine-gems">So why do we still tend to use state machine gems</h3>

<p>The main reason is state change validation. It won’t be easy to always check if it is possible to transition object from state A to state B in plain Ruby.
This part of state machine is something that really matter.</p>

<p>In my head it appears as some kind of allowed changes map:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">order_state_changes_map</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> 
  <span class="kp">nil</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:pending</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="c1"># Initial state is always pending</span>
  <span class="ss">:pending</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:approved</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:rejected</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="c1"># Pending can be changed to to paid and delivered</span>
  <span class="ss">:approved</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="ss">:paid</span> <span class="c1"># Delivered can only be changed to paid</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>If the state machine’s main goal is to validate changes than let’s implement it as a validation:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Order</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">AR</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>
  <span class="n">validates</span> <span class="ss">:state</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:changes</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">order_state_changes_map</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div>

<p>With this pattern you can define state change methods in ruby:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">validates</span> <span class="ss">:state</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:changes</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span> 
  <span class="kp">nil</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:pending</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="c1"># Initial state is always pending</span>
  <span class="ss">:pending</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:approved</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:rejected</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="c1"># Pending can be changed to to paid and delivered</span>
  <span class="ss">:approved</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="ss">:paid</span> <span class="c1"># Delivered can only be changed to paid</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">upproved!</span>
  <span class="c1"># ....</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">upproved?</span>
  <span class="c1"># ....</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Now it looks really readable and a person who never saw this kind of API before can figure out what is happening.</p>

        </h2>
        <p>I have a constant feeling that in a modern web every web form should be submitted with AJAX not the old retro way with POST request. This is better for numerous reasons.</p>

<p>At first, it gives better user experience
At second, AJAX is faster than regular request.
At the end,  it doesn’t require a work to redraw the page with it’s previous state if validation fails.</p>

<p>Currently I am trying to make rails app support this out of the box.
And here is first small step to this goal:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8638">This patch</a> allows a complete validation though ajax using active model validators.
This is a <a href="http://rails-ajax-validation.herokuapp.com/developers/new">live demo</a> of what it allows to do.
If you feel especially interested in this feature, say your +1 here or on github.</p>

        <p>I heard about 10 different ways to organize work flow around pivotaltracker and git and about 5 gems to support that process.
All of them seems abusing for me: the outcome of pivotal/git integration is a git commit attached to pivotal story and the rest of conventions like naming branches or merge policy doesn’t make any sense in long time perspective and is just a waste of time in fact. </p>

<h2 id="how-should-i-name-branches">How should I name branches?</h2>

<p>Branch names is not something that you should focus on. Unlike commit messages, branches are removed from history after merge. That is why you should name them in a way that takes less of your time. I personally prefer to have only one branch for myself called <code>bogdandev</code> when I work on a project. When the feature is not done - there is no sense to work on another feature.</p>
